        <li>5 tablespoons malt vinegar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 red chilli</li>

    <h3><em>Chilli Squid</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 squids, body only</li>
        <li>100g cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shichimi</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons spicy vinegar</li>
        <li>280ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the sugar and 2 tbsp water in a small saucepan over a medium-low heat and stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and add the soy sauce and vinegar.</li>
        <li>Take your coriander, remove the stalks and chop finely. Then deseed and finely chop your chilli. Add them both to the soy and vinegar mix just before use.</li>
        <li>Prepare the squid. Rinse them under cold water and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Ensure the squid are thoroughly dry before frying for good, crispy results.</li>
        <li>Transfer the squid to a chopping board and slice them open down the middle so you are left with a rectangular shape. Remove any thin or excess skin to ensure the surface is smooth and soft.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, lightly score the inside of the squid in a small grid or diamond pattern, then slice into 1 inch-wide pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the cornstarch in a shallow bowl and dip the squid pieces in the cornstarch, making sure they are all thoroughly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep skillet or wok. Once the oil is hot, add the squid pieces, and fry for approximately 2 minutes until pale golden. Do not fry for too long as they will become tough and chewy, work in batches if necessary.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Add the fried squid into a bowl and sprinkle the shichimi and salt over the top. Give the squid a good toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with the spicy vinegar on the side for dipping. Tuck in! Enjoy!</li>
